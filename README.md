# Today
In July 2022, I came up with the idea of a mobile dating app that would work on activity mechanics. That is, the user creates an event (jogging, going to the cinema, apartment building, etc.), and then selects from those who are interested in this event.

A year later, I finally sat down to work on the project, but after a while it became clear that the app might be interesting to someone, but its economics are so-so. In order to somehow justify the time and effort spent, I decided to publish my work for those who were planning something similar.

Technology Stack: VSCode, Flutter SDK, Firebase Services (Firestore, Storage, Messaging, Analytics), Bloc, Provider, Hive and Sizer.

Runs on Flutter version 3.16.5.
